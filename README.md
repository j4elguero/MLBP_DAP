# Machine Learning Basis Principles
## Data Analysis Project

This project is my particular solution to the main project of the subject *Machine Learning Basic Principles*, taught at Aalto University during the fall of 2018.

It was part of a Kaggle competition where we were given a subset of the whole dataset and where asked to elaborate a classification algorithm that would identify the type of music genre based on a set of features. The performance was measured by applying this algorithm to a test dataset and uploading the resulting classes back to Kaggle to see the results.
